# Neural Network Framework
## Description
Learning project to get insight of how neuron learn and the process of backpropagation and optimization.<br>
There are sophisticated frameworks out there such as Keras/Caffee but I wanted to code it from scratch to deeply understand what is going on behind the scene instead of
just using the framwork APIs. <br>
Since my ultiamte goal is to learn self driving cars, I only implemented multiclass classification framework.
I learned a lot from this project and got deeper understanding of neural network learing challenges by playing with hyper parameters.
